                        Pretz was already a popular pretzel stick snack item. The simple concept of covering it with chocolate was the beginning of Pocky. The innovative new idea of leaving an uncoated end came about in the process trying to figure out how not to soil the fingers with chocolate. <br />
                        Featuring convenience and a unique shape, Pocky has since been a long-selling market leader. Promotion campaigns for Pocky have included such slogans as "Pocky on a Trip" to advertise its convenient portability and "Pocky on the Rocks" to draw the attention of adults that it is a taste treat served "on the Rocks" in a wine glass at drinking establishments. Over the years, many new variations – such as strawberry flavored or Almond Crush that is topped with finely crushed almond bits – have become available. <br />
                        Confectionery available from Glico incorporates the accumulation of ideas including the harmonization of chocolate and snacks, the creation of enjoyment that extends to all generations, the br /eaking of geographic border barriers, and the ability to br /ing smiles to the faces of consumers around the globe.

                        The idea of encouraging adults to experience the joy of eating confectionery br /ought about the development of new confectionery products that tastefully complement alcoholic beverages. <br />
                        In Japan, it is customary to serve such snacks as nuts, lightly fried seafood items, or rice crackers with alcoholic beverages. Building on this, Cratz - launched in 2005 – has earned praise as one of the best snacks with beer. Other products creatively developed to satisfy leisurely adult moments are Cheeza – a cheese cracker that provides a freshly-baked, crispy sensation that goes well even with wine.

                        Glico has continued its research to incorporate functionality into confectionery. One example is POs-Ca gum that enables the calcium it contains to mix with saliva in such as way as to remineralize teeth and thereby make them stronger. <br />
                        Since research has shown that a coated, dirty tongue is the leading cause of bad br /eath, another functional item is the br /eo br /eath mint that also acts to clean the tongue. <br />
                        In addition, there is GABA – a chocolate that focuses on the sensation of relief that comes with eating chocolate. This product incorporates Gamma-Amino Butyric Acid that plays a vital role in regulating neural excitability throughout the nervous system and that is responsible for the regulation of muscle tone. <br />
                        Through such products, Glico continues to innovatively create new joys of eating confectionery.
