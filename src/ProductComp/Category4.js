                        Pucchin Pudding is well known throughout Japan for its appealing taste, palate-pleasing texture, and unique flower-shaped container. In 2012, sales of this popular Glico product surpassed the 5.1 billion mark. <br />
                        The success of Pucchin Pudding can be traced back to when the development team was striving to find an efficient, practical method to serve this product in a manner similar to that practiced in pastry shops where a pastry chef or server turns the container upside-down over a plate and pokes a hole with an ice pick to make it possible for the contents to slide out smoothly and efficiently so that the soft caramel underneath flows out to be on top. However, it took much thought, effort, and time to develop today's popular flower-shaped container with its" Snap-Out" function. <br />
                        As the popularity of this product grew, vendors began to stock the "3-Pack" ‒ a success that led to the development of "Big Pucchin Pudding" , the larger sized "Happy Pucchin Pudding", and the 1-kilogram sized "Make-at-Home" Pucchin Pudding. Whatever the size and wherever purchased, Pucchin Pudding products br /ing smiles to the faces of consumers. <br />
                        Successfully introduced in 2007 was Dororich ‒ the fruitful result of incorporating advanced Glico technological development to br /ing forth a drinkable dessert. In fact, this innovative idea has been responsible for the creation of a wholly new and popular dessert genre.

                        Choshoku Bifix yogurt contributes to the joy of eating and the enhancement of health by providing a nose-pleasing aroma and a palate-pleasing taste. It further features a firm texture that makes it easy to eat with a spoon. This, then, is yet another example of the unique methods incorporated by Glico to deliver wholesome and tasty products.

                        The ingredients for Glico products are individually selected from among the very best available around the world. Once a site is chosen, Glico staff members are dispatched to work hand-in-hand with local producers to ensure the most-efficient cultivation of the best possible crops. The deep aroma of Café-au-Lait and the crispy feel of Choshoku Ringo Yogurt, for example, have been realized only through such encounters. <br />
                        The origins of Tokusen Milk are five highland farms carefully selected to ensure the finest taste and quality. Due to the fact that milk-producing cows are susceptible to summer heat as well as to stress, these locations provide cool and comforting environments. In addition, their superior pasturages are rich in minerals. <br />
                        To preserve maximum freshness, Tokusen Milk is delivered direct from each of the highland farms to the closest concentration of consumers.
