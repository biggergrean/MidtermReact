                        <p className="description-custom">
                        For over half a century Glico has continuously been delivering "A Wholesome Life in the Best of Taste" by also providing food ingredients to Japanese producers and processors. In the beginning, our main products were tasty flavoring agents. The next step was the production and sales of A-glu – a wheat protein (gluten) that enhances quality while providing a satisfied appreciation for the products in which it is contained. In fact, our wheat protein products have currently achieved the largest share of the domestic market in their field as a result of becoming food ingredients in recipes of a br /oad range of such producers and food processors as noodle makers, bakeries, and side dish makers. <br />
                        Over the years, we have br /oadened our ability to provide food ingredients that fulfill the specific requirements of food production and processing customers. In part, this has been accomplished through the development, production, and sales of various forms of starch derived from wheat, tapioca, and potatoes along with an enhanced range of coloring agents. <br />
                        Glico constantly explores new market possibilities while seeking to positively respond to the needs of customers around the world. Towards accomplishing these goals, we have amplified our material lineup to include fine chemicals.

                        <h4><b>Developing Unique, Safe, and Reliable Materials</b></h4> <br />
                        <p className="description-custom">
                        Glico successfully develops new materials by conducting research, leading to the development of original technological advances that make it possible to respond positively to varied customer needs. Further, stringent production control, along with an effective and efficient quality control system based on our unique technical know-how ensures maximum material safety and reliability. <br />
                        As part of fulfilling the needs and requests of our customers, we have successfully developed an ample range of wheat proteins featuring diverse physical properties. Those wheat protein materials include A-glu – the starting point of Glico's business related to food ingredients. <br />
                        Starches developed by Glico successfully apply enzyme technology to develop materials that often feature previously little-known characteristics. One such enzyme-treated starch is marketed under the commercial name of Chemistar-E Series. Other types of starch added to our already abundant material lineup include those offered under the commercial names of Ginrin and Chemistar. <br />
                        Also available is a wide range of coloring agents that include the Gardenia-flower-derived Kuchina Color and Monas Color that is extracted and refined from the Monascus purpureus species of mold. In addition, unique materials developed as part of our constant efforts to support various production and processing industries include the ethanol-based agent E&F and specially processed rice powder. <br />
                        Glico's fine chemicals are produced incorporating innovative developments based on carbohydrate engineering and enzyme technologies. Further, the function and safety of the fine chemical products, α-Arbutin, Cluster Dextrin, POs-Ca (Phosphoryl Oligosaccharides of Calcium), Bioglycogen, and Bioamylose are all supported by scientific evidence and extensive safety data. As a result, their superior quality and practical functions are making positive contributions to the development of high added-value products in various global production and processing fields including general food products, health food products, cosmetics, daily-use products, chemical products, and medical supplies. <br />
                        In summary, we are firmly resolved to take all the steps necessary to satisfactorily meet the challenges of fulfilling the needs and requests of customers around the world by making the most efficient use of not only our own in-house resources, but also of our global procurement network for materials and raw materials from suppliers both domestic and international.
